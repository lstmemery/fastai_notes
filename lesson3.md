# Lesson 3

## Notes on Notebooks
- Check the notebooks (actually write them)
- Type in the solutions from scratch
- You can put the completed notebooks side-by-side
- Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks
- Deep Visualization Toolbox is also really cool
- Deeper layers are more concept level

## Convolutions
- matrix multiply small kernels over image
- shows edge detector
- What's the optimal way to design filters?
- Deep learning answers that question (with SGD)
- Going to talk about filter sizes
