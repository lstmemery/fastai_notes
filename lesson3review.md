# Lesson 3

Presented by Andrew

Underfitting and Overfitting
Need to find a happy middle
Complexity tends to be proportional to the number of parameters

Avoid underfitting
1. Add layers
2. Add sophisicated layers
3. Expand layers
4. Remove regularization

Steps to avoid overfitting:
1. Add data
2. Data augmentation
3. Use architectures that generalize well
	- mostly batch norm
4. Add Regularization
